## Introduction

NooBaa offers NSFS Prometheus metrics to provide detailed information on buckets and I/O operations. The following document contains instructions on how to get started with fetching these metrics, understanding the additional information they offer, and includes examples and more.  
Read more about NSFS metrics at - [NSFS metrics design](./../design/NSFSMetrics.md).

## Metrics Endpoint Configuration

This section provides details about the metrics URL and port configuration necessary for accessing and monitoring system metrics.

#### Prometheus Metrics URL - </br>

- NooBaa exports the system statistics via the following URL - </br> `http://{host}:{metrics_port}/metrics/nsfs_stats`

- Default port - 7004

- Prometheus metrics port configuration - </br> Changing Prometheus metrics port can be done by changing EP_METRICS_SERVER_PORT in config.json. </br>
  For more details about configuring metrics port see - [Non Containerized NooBaa Developer Customization](./ConfigFileCustomizations.md)

## Metrics description

### I/O Metrics

The I/O Metrics table provides a detailed overview of the input/output operations performed by the system. It includes metrics for the total number of read and write operations as well as the total amount of data read and written, measured in bytes. These metrics help in understanding the overall I/O activity and data transfer rates within the system.

| Metric Name                      | Description                      | Unit       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| noobaa_nsfs_io_read_count        | Total number of read operations  | operations |
| noobaa_nsfs_io_write_count       | Total number of write operations | operations |
| noobaa_nsfs_io_read_bytes        | Total bytes read                 | bytes      |
| noobaa_nsfs_io_write_bytes       | Total bytes written              | bytes      |
| noobaa_nsfs_io_error_read_count  | Total number of read errors      | operations |

| noobaa_nsfs_io_error_write_bytes | Total write error bytes          | bytes      |

### Per-Operation Metrics

The Per-Operation Metrics table details the performance and count of specific operations related to bucket and object management. It includes metrics such as the minimum, maximum, and average time taken for creating buckets, uploading objects, heading objects, and reading objects. Additionally, it tracks the total number of operations and any errors encountered. These metrics are essential for analyzing the efficiency and reliability of different operations within the system.

## Getting Started

This section will walk you through the initial steps required to enable the NSFS service and subsequently fetch the relevant metrics. By following these instructions, you'll gain access to detailed information about bucket and I/O operations, which can help you monitor and optimize your system performance.

#### 1. Enabling the NSFS Service </br>

To begin collecting metrics, you need to enable the NSFS service. Follow the steps specified in [NooBaa Non Containerized Configuration](./Configuration.md)

#### 2. Running I/O Operations

After enabling the NSFS service, you'll need to perform some I/O operations to generate metrics. Follow these steps:

- Create an account -</br>
  Use NooBaa CLI for creating an account

- Create a bucket -</br>
  Create a bucket using S3 (S3 bucket) or using NooBaa CLI (exported bucket).

- Upload and Download Objects -</br>
  Upload and Download objects to/from the selected bucket (step 2) using the newly created account (step 1).
  Ensure that a variety of object sizes and types are uploaded to generate diverse metrics.
  Repeat this process multiple times to create significant I/O activity.

For specific command examples, refer to the steps outlined in [NooBaa Non Containerized Configuration](./Configuration.md)

#### 3. Fetching Metrics

Once the NSFS service is enabled, you can fetch the Prometheus metrics to monitor your system. Open a new tab and follow these steps:

```sh
noobaa-cli diagnose metrics
# OR directly fetch
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7004/metrics/nsfs_stats | jq .
```
